# Brackets
_Some back story:_

Awhile back I was looking for something that worked a bit better than Nodepad++. I had previously tried Sublime and just was not a fan of it. Something it about it just seemed _annoying_ and I'll be honest even now I can't explain why. 

What I found was "If I didn't want to use Sublime" my options were pretty slim. I did find two things, however: Brackets and Atom.

They were both appealing because they were highly customizable, and backed by fairly large companies (Adobe for Brackets, Git for Atom). I gave them both an honest try. I built the exact same project thru both, and in the end I found I just preferred Brackets over Atom. It's been my go-to editor since.

## Why?

Simply put: I hate doing extra that I don't **_have_** to do.
